  My project proposal deals with sports attendance particularly NBA teams and the factors that affect it and how teams can imporove that alongside other areas on their team.
 My clients will be NBA sports teams and contractors looking to boost their ticket sales per season. My client will care about my project 
 because of how it can boost their teams value in regards to players and management from other teams wanting to relocate
there and play for them. Alongside that they will also care due to how the teams revenue can drasticlly increase due to the adjustments
advised. The data I will use are Nba teams road and home attendance data, the teams location median household income, the teams revenue,
the teams operating income, win to player cost ratio, metro area population, player expenses, and the teams roster salary. 
I will be obtaining all of the data online since it is viewable by the public. My approach to solving my problem is after analysing all
the data used i will then use the program that I plan on creating will then be able to accurately depict what variable within the team 
can be improved either it being the location, management or players. Then I will simulate the results that my program advised and run it 
for a whole season on real life basketball video game called 2k19 due to that being the most accurate and realistic representation of an 
NBA season with my adjustments I can get. The delivarbles I will have is a python program alongside a slide deck.
